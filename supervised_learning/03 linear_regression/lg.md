### 1. **Read in the Ecommerce Customers csv file as a DataFrame called customers.**
### 2. Perform data analysis on this data (head, info, describe)
### 3. visualize dataset using sns ( jointplot for Time on Website vs Yearly Amount Spent)
### 4. do the same but with TIme on App column instead
### 5. **Use jointplot to create a 2D hex bin plot comparing Time on App and Length of Membership.**
### 6. visulize using pairplot
### 7. **Based off this plot what looks to be the most correlated feature with Yearly Amount Spent?**
### 8. **Create a linear model plot (using seaborn's lmplot) of  Yearly Amount Spent vs. Length of Membership.**
